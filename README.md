# Useful-Scripts-Algos

This repository features original scripts and algorithms that I find useful for automating repetitive tasks at work (I'm an SEO content editor). In some cases, there are paid solutions available online. However, my solutions are free to use and custom-tailored to be **exactly** what I need. 

More importantly, I consider this great practice for implementing what I'm learning as I study web development. It's very rewarding to go from having a real-world problem to coming up with a custom solution from scratch.

These scripts work by altering files directly on your computer. The tools are only limited to editing documents inside the Useful-Scripts-Algos directory (so they won't damage anything else on your computer) but be sure to back up any completed work inside this folder before you run one of these scripts again.

In order to run these scripts, please install Ruby (the programming language these tools were created in) using the instructions below.

***Windows:*** https://rubyinstaller.org/

***Mac:*** https://stackify.com/install-ruby-on-your-mac-everything-you-need-to-get-going/

Inside each sub-folder, you'll find instructions for using the script.

**Clean Links**

I created this script because I had a task at work where I needed to remove the referral part of 100+ Amazon links. There are Excel formulas that achieve similar things. However, there were some variables involved in cleaning links in bulk that meant it was easier for me to just create my own solution.

**Extract Emails**

I created this script because I had a folder of nearly 500 resumes in .PDF and and .docx format and needed to extract the emails from them. There are paid solutions available to do this in bulk for Windows but the only free ones I found merely handled single files. My solution works on Windows or OS X and handles **all** the PDF/DOCX files in a given folder.

**Lineup Parse**

This is a custom script I created to help a family member reduce the burden of one of their most stressful tasks at work. The program is so specific that I doubt it will be of much use to anybody else. Still documenting it here for portfolio purposes. Basically, the program looks through a Word Document line by line and categorizes each one based on an agreed-upon formatting convention. Then, it reorganizes the file into a useful format for the task (figuring out which workers were present on a particular jobsite).

Truth be told, I know there's software out there that can do this but implementing it would require a change in management processes at a company I don't work for. My solution takes the file as my family member receives it and produces something useful to them.
