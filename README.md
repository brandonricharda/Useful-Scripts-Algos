# Useful-Scripts-Algos

This repository features original scripts and algorithms that I find useful for automating repetitive tasks at work. In some cases, there are paid solutions available online. However, my solutions are free to use, custom-tailored to be **exactly** what I need, and also great for me to develop for practice as I learn Ruby, Javascript, and other languages.

These scripts work by altering files directly on your computer. The tools are only limited to editing documents inside the Useful-Scripts-Algos (so they won't damage anything else on your computer) but be sure to back up any completed work inside this folder before you run one of these scripts again.

In order to run these scripts, please install Ruby (the programming language these tools were created in) using the instructions below.

***Windows:*** https://rubyinstaller.org/

***Mac:*** https://stackify.com/install-ruby-on-your-mac-everything-you-need-to-get-going/

Inside each sub-folder, you'll find instructions for using the script.

**Clean Links**

I created this script because I had a task at work where I needed to remove the referral part of 100+ Amazon links. There are Excel formulas that achieve similar things. However, there were some variables involved in cleaning links in bulk that meant it was easier for me to just create my own solution.

**Extract Emails**

I created this script because I had a folder of nearly 500 resumes in .PDF and and .docx format and needed to extract the emails from them. There are paid solutions available to do this in bulk but the only free ones I found only handled single files.
